I am currently an [Institute for Foundations of Data Science](https://ifds.info/) (IFDS) Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington, working with [Dmitriy Drusvyatskiy](https://sites.google.com/view/dmitriy-drusvyatskiy) and [Maryam Fazel](https://people.ece.uw.edu/fazel_maryam/). I received my PhD in Computer Science from UCSD, where 
 I was fortunate to be advised by  [Mikhail Belkin](http://misha.belkin-wang.org/). Prior to UCSD, I received my BS in Mathematics from Zhejiang University. 

I am broadly interested in the **optimization** and **mathematical foundations** of machine learning.  My core research interest is in establishing the mathematical foundations for modern deep learning and designing theoretically
grounded algorithms that advance existing methods.  In recent work, we showed that kernel methods are capable of implementing **feature** and **hierarchical learning** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08277)).
